							<p>A web application is like a house built on a foundation. Today, many web apps have clean design with a weak foundation OR they have a strong foundation with poor design. Our collaborative design and development experts from the LmntrX team work together to develop a clean house on a strong foundation. Design fidelity is monitored like a hawk and code fidelity is analyzed also. 
							Today’s web allows you to do more for less and faster by integrating with cutting-edge frameworks and open-source technologies. Whether open source or on the Microsoft stack, we’ve utilized a number of frameworks and libraries that reduce custom code development and help the development process go faster. We leverage several automated deployment mechanisms that allow code to be put live in minutes, not hours. We’re technology agnostic and have enough talent specializing in multiple platforms and languages to pick the right technology to meet your needs.
							By working with a creative digital consulting firm, you will find that a successful website is connected to digital strategy, tools, and execution. By understanding online advertising, social media marketing, video marketing, online advertising, copywriting, branding, web analytics, email campaigns, SaaS tool integrations, and more, we can provide you with the planning, integration, and execution to help your website work for you.
							Responsive web design carries a uniform message to your target audience on any screen. Our team’s attention to detail weaves into a seamless interface. We stay on top of cutting edge innovation, fueling your site with an arsenal of technical power. Engage with our development experts to make your web app fresh. Already have a website? Our team can conduct a design review or in-depth code, infrastructure, and technologies analysis to suggest game-changing and incremental improvements.<p>

							Quality design creates appeal and demand. And we understand that creative people should be sales people because design is a function of selling. We produce quality and cutting edge brand and marketing materials to evoke emotion and inspire trust.
							Today, there is too much data, so visualization is more important than ever. There’s a reason why Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumble took off. Our experience includes a variety of marketing and advertising assets, in both digital and print media, such as…
						⦁	Info graphics
						⦁	Postcards
						⦁	Business Cards
						⦁	Advertisements
						⦁	Brochures
						⦁	Event Banners
						⦁	Sales / DataSheets
							We want to quickly understand your history, your audience, your objectives, your competitors, and your market, so we can generate fresh graphic content that promotes positive public engagement with your brand and tells your company story. That could be a 15 minute conversation over the phone or lengthy research project, but we believe building a creative brief is foundational to achieving the objectives.
							The LmntrX creative team thrives in the collaborative process and will encourage your input throughout. We developed an online collaboration platform that brings transparency to our progress and results.</p>

							<p>The user interface is the window through which the world experiences your website, application, or system. Even the most sophisticated code and transcendent design fail if the site lacks usability. A powerful user interface bridges the distance between the human brain and the digital product. Understanding human behavior is key to unlocking an exceptional user experience. Whether you are refreshing an existing website or starting from the ground up, our team can collaborate with you to create a fresh experience.
							One of our advantages is our array of holistic digital offerings. We love to start with UI work, and we can quickly proceed to front-end design and back-end development, then marketing if needed. We understand the big picture in the UI planning stage, so we design in context of execution, knowing all the cutting edge capabilities of modern technology. Because we are with you from concept to delivery, we can execute with speed and agility.<p>

							When we approach any problem or opportunity, we like to start with high level questions to understand…
						⦁	How does this make money or add value to your company? (business strategy)
						⦁	How can we be more efficient with this work? (technology strategy)
						⦁	What makes you unique and how can we increase appeal? (creative strategy)
						⦁	Who are your users and how can we reach them? (marketing strategy)
							
							With any new idea, we like to think big picture as we get ready to drive something to success. Then, as we frame up the problem or opportunity, we have a picture of where we can add the most value. In the process, we may explore how to double your revenue, reduce expenses in half, and grow your bottom line. After all, this is business.
							

							Our team will build your website or web app or Mobile App to ensure your content is optimized for discoverability, using platforms and search engine optimization (SEO) tools to automate the process for the content you publish. We understand how content marketing, social marketing, and optimization can give you “search engine juice”. Our recommendations tap knowledge and experience to bring your site to the forefront of the web.
							As we start a collaborative dialogue, we want to frame the problem or opportunity by understanding your business, your audience, your ideas, your needs, your competitors and more. Once we have framed up the problem or opportunity with enough background information from our detailed briefs, we have the creative constraints to think freely and innovate.</p>
